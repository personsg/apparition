# Apparition
AI Toolkit


## PROTON
Prompt sandbox, catalog, and editor

## FIGMENT
Toolking for creating AI agents from a set of descriptor, rules, and custom code and tools. Agents can be single agents (chatbot), or multi-agent collaborative (simulate a team of developers, or realistic video game village)

## SPECTER
Drag-and-drop flows for building AI agent flows (e.g. RAG) and serverless APIs

## PHANTOM
Simulation platform for digital twins. Examples:
- Simulated video game village with multiple intelligent NPCs
- Simulate a complex environment (e.g. compute or cloud resources) and reason about / make simulated changes to the environment.
- Build an internal simlution of a complex environment (e.g. a video game, or a city) and orchestrate actions to apply in "real" world.
